2. Assuming the target mean is 15 and the in-control standard deviation is $\sigma$= 2.0,

a) make a cusum chart with h = 4 that will quickly detect a one $\sigma$ shift in the mean in the following Phase II data: 10.5 14.0 15.4 10.7 13.7 13.3 16.4 17.2 14.2 12.6 12.9 13.4 13.0 10.7 10.8 12.9 12.1 10.1 11.4 10.9


Note: Using the argument se.shift=1 in the following code is equivalent to k = $\frac{1}{2}$, which will detect a one $\sigma$ shift in the mean quickly.

```{r}
library(qcc)
x<-c(10.5,14.0,15.4,10.7,13.7,13.3,16.4,17.2,14.2,12.6,12.9,13.4,13.0,10.7,10.8,12.9,12.1,
10.1,11.4,10.9)
p2<-cusum(x,decision.interval=4,se.shift=1,center=15,std.dev=2.0)
summary(p2)
```

b) Calculate the ARL$_0$ for the chart you constructed in part a).

```{r}
library(spc)
xcusum.arl(0,k=.5,h=4,sided="two")
```

3. If $\lambda$ = .3, find the value of $L$ for an EWMA chart that would match the $ARL_0$ of the cusum chart you
   made in question 2.
   
```{r}
xewma.crit(mu=0,l=.3,L0=167.6838,sided="two")
```

Therefore, if $\lambda$=.3, the value of $L$ to match the $ARL_0$ of the Cusum chart with $k$=.5 and $h$=4 is $L$=2.6488.

a) Make the EWMA chart of the data in exercise 2 using $\lambda=.3$ and the value of $L$ you determined above.

```{r}
library(qcc)
ewma(x,center=15,std.dev=2.0,lambda=.3, nsigmas=2.6488)
```

b) Are the results the same as they were for the cusum char in exercise 2?

Answer: Yes

4. E.L. Grant(1946) showed the following data from a Chemical plant. The numbers represent the daily analyses of the percentages on unreacted lime (CaO) at an intermediate stage of a continuous process. 

.24,.13,.11,.19,.16,.17,.13,.17,.10,.14,.16,.14,.17,.15,.20,.26,.16,0.0,.18,.18,.20,.11,.30,.21,.11,.17,.18,.13,.28,
.16,.14,.16,.14,.10,.13,.20,.14,.10,.18,.11,.08,.12,.13,.12,.17,.10,.09

a) Make a Cusum chart of the data assuming the in-control mean was $\mu=0.15$ and the in-control standard deviation $\sigma=.04$. use $k=\frac{1}{2}$ and $h=5$.

```{r}
CaO<-c(.24,.13,.11,.19,.16,.17,.13,.17,.10,.14,.16,.14,.17,.15,.20,.26,.16,0.0,.18,.18,
       .20,.11,.30,.21,.11,.17,.18,.13,.28,.16,.14,.16,.14,.10,.13,.20,.14,.10,.18,.11,
       .08,.12,.13,.12,.17,.10,.09)
library(qcc)
cusum(CaO,center=.15, std.dev=.04,decision.interval=5, se.shift=1)
```

b) Remake the chart using the head start feature. Is there any difference in the two charts?

```{r} 
library(qcc)
cusum(CaO,center=.15, std.dev=.04,decision.interval=5, se.shift=1,head.start=2.5,sided="two")
```

Answer: The first point is closer to the control or decision limit when using the head start feature, but beyond observation 11, there is little difference. 

c) When would you recommend using the head start feature with individual data from a chemical plant?

Answer: If the process was adjusted after out of control points were found, I would recommend implementing the head start feature when monitoring data after the adjustment.

d) Make a EWMA chart with the similar $ARL_0$ and the head start feature.

Answer: From Table 6.6 $ARL_0$ for the cusum chart with $k$=.5, $h$=5 is 465.44, and an EWMA with $\lambda=.2$ and $L=2.938$ has a similar $ARL_0$ (i.e. 465.48). To incorporate the head start feature in the EWMA chart we need to recalculate the control limits using Eq (6.8) as shown in the code below.

```{r}
library(qcc)
EW<-ewma(CaO,center=.15,std.dev=.04,lambda=.2,nsigmas=2.938,plot=FALSE)
# recalculate limits using Eq (6.8) with f=.5 and a=[-2/log(1-f)-1]/15
lambda<-.2
L<-2.938
center<-.15
std.dev<-.04
f<-.5
a<-(-2/(log(1-f))-1)/19
t<-1:47
UCL<-center+(L*std.dev)*((1-(1-f)^(1+a*(t-1)) )*sqrt((lambda/(2-lambda))*(1-(1-lambda)^(2*t))) )
LCL<-center-(L*std.dev)*((1-(1-f)^(1+a*(t-1)) )*sqrt((lambda/(2-lambda))*(1-(1-lambda)^(2*t))) )
EW$limits[ ,1]<-LCL
EW$limits[ ,2]<-UCL
plot(EW)
```

e) Is the result the same as the Cusum chart used in b)

Answer: Yes the first point is very close to the upper control limit (similar to the Cusum with headstart) but still within the limit since the point is black not red. 

5. Using Borror et. al.(1998)’s method, make an EWMA control chart of the count data data in Table  6.10 assuming $\mu_0$ = 1.88 and using $\lambda$ = 0.2, and $A$ = 2.55.

```{r}
x<-c(3,1,4,1,3,1,5,4,5,5)
Z<-c(rep(0,10))
Z[1]<-.2*x[1]+.8*1.88
for (i in 2:10) {
Z[i]<-.2*x[i]+.8*Z[i-1]
}
M<-cbind(x,Z)
colnames(M)<-c("x=count","Z=EWMA") 
M
UCL<-1.88+2.55*sqrt((.2*1.88/(2-.2))) 
LCL<-1.88-2.55*sqrt((.2*1.88/(2-.2))) 
cat("UCL = ",UCL," LCL = ",LCL)
```

a) do you detect any out of control signal? If so at what observation number?

Answer: Yes at observation 9 UCL is exceeded.

b) If $\mu_0$ = 4.0, and $\lambda$ = 0.3, what values of $A$ would you recomend to obtain an $ARL_0$ = 500 for an EWMA
   chart made with Borror et. al.(1998)â€™s method.
   
Answer: about $A$=3.1 from Figure 2 in the Lecture Slides.


6. Hawkins proposed a Cusum chart of $v_i=\frac{\sqrt{|y_i}-0.822}{0.349}$, where $y_i=(x_i-\mu)/\sigma$ to detect changes in the standard deviation of $x_i$. 

a) Can you use an EWMA chart with individual observations to detect an increase in the standard deviation?

Answer: Yes

b) If so, do it with the data in the first column of Table 6.1 and assuming $\mu_0=50$ and $\sigma_0=5.$ 

Answer: to get an EWMA chart with properties similar to Hawkins Cusum chart for detecting a 50\% increase in the standard deviation, use $\lambda=.05$ and $L=2.31934$ as shown in Table 6.8.

```{r}
library(qcc)
x<-c(40.208,56.211,51.236,60.686,45.230,49.849,52.491,59.762,59.462,59.302,55.679,57.155,
60.219,56.770,55.949)
y<-(x-50)/5
v<-(sqrt(abs(y))-.822)/.349
e2<-ewma(v,center=0,std.dev=1,lambda=.05,nsigmas=2.31934)
```

7. The data in the data vector $\verb!x2!$ in the R package $\verb!IAcsSPCR!$ is from Phase II monitoring. The in-control mean and standard deviation are unknown, but the data in the vector $\verb!x1!$ in the R package $\verb!IAcsSPCR!$ are from a Phase I study after eliminating out-of control data points. 

a) Find the 90th percentile of the multiplier $L$ for the control limits of a Phase II EWMA chart with $\lambda=.2$ so that the $ARL_0$ will be guaranteed to be at least 465.48 90% of the time.

```{r}
library(IAcsSPCR)
data(x1)
library(spcadjust)
chart<-new("SPCEWMA",model=SPCModelNormal(Delta=0),lambda=.2)
xihat<-xiofdata(chart,x1)
str(xihat)
str(xihat)
cal<-SPCproperty(data=x1,nrep=1000,property="calARL",chart=chart,
                 params=list(target=465.48),quiet=TRUE)
cal
## assuming the threshold = 1.213
L<-1.213/sqrt(.2/(2-.2))
L
```

b) Use the multiplier you found in a) to construct the EWMA control chart of the data in the vector $\verb!x2!$.

```{r}
library(IAcsSPCR)
data(x2)
library(qcc)
ewma(x2,center=xihat$mu, std.dev=xihat$sd,lambda=.2,nsigmas=3.639)
```



c) Has the process remained in control during Phase II?

Answer: No exceeds upper control limit at point 13.
