Description: The package includes functions for recalling single, double, and multiple attribute
 sampling plans from the Military Standard (MIL-STD-105E)-American National Standards Institute/American
 Society for Quality (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4) tables and variable sampling plans from Military Standard
 (MIL-STD-414)-American National Standards Institute/American Society for Quality (ANSI/ASQ Z1.9)
 tables. The sources for these tables are listed in the URL: field. Also included are functions
 for computing the OC and ASN coordinates for the attribute plans it recalls, and functions for
 computing the estimated proportion nonconforming and the maximum allowable proportion nonconforming
 for variable sampling plans. The MIL-STD AQL Sampling schemes were the most used and copied set of
 standards in the world. They are intended to be used for sampling a stream of lots, and were used
 in contract agreements between supplier and customer companies. When the US military dropped support
 of MIL-STD 105E and 414, The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards
 Organization (ISO) adopted the standard with few changes or no changes to the central tables.
 This package is useful because its computer implementation of these tables duplicates that available
 in other commercial software and subscription online calculators.
